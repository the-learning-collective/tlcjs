To work through this curriculum, you will need to have a way to write
and run Javascript programs. Javascript programs can be run in various
ways, but the most common way is to run them with a web browser like
Firefox.

In order to run a Javascript program with a web browser, you
need a small page that tells the browser what to do. Browsers read
HTML pages that tell them not only what text and images to display on
the screen, but also any Javascript that should be run.

To try examples in this text or write your own programs, you should create two files. You
should do this with a _Text Editor_, which is like a word
processor but for programs. A good (mostly) free one that runs on
Macs, Windows, and Linux is called http://www.sublimetext.com/[_Sublime Text_] (mostly free means
that it costs money, but it has a free trial that lasts forever).

Create a folder where you can hold all the programs you will write throughout this curiculum; name the folder `tlcjs`. Then open up
Sublime Text and create two new files in this folder:
`example1.html` and `example1.js`.  In
"example1.html" -- which is the file that you will open with your web
browser -- we need to tell the web browser that we want to run
`example1.js`. We also want to include some pre-constructed
functionality for this curiculum. All HTML files start with a declaration of the particular version of HTML that we are using. HTML dates back to 1993, and many changes have happened, but to tell the browser that we want the current version, we start every HTML file with:

----
<!doctype html>
----

(By the way, we recommend typing, not copying this, so you
get the muscle memory of coding in your fingers!)

Then we need to start a section of the HTML document called the
"body." There are different parts of HTML documents, but this is the only one we need:

----
<body id="tlc-body">
----

Finally, we need to tell the browser that we want to run some
Javascript. There is a _tag_ (the name for these words inside
`<` and `>` that instruct the browser to do things) called `script`
that tells the browser to run a particular javascript file. First, we
need to include some common functionality (called `libraries`) - one
that is a popular open source library, and one that was written for
this curriculum:

----
  <script src="http://tlcjs.org/js/lodash.min.js"></script>
  <script src="http://tlcjs.org/js/tlc.js"></script>
----

Lastly, we need to tell it to include our `example1.js` file (which we
haven't written yet):

----
  <script src="example1.js"></script>
----

Now save that file. It should look something like (for why the `<script>` lines are further in than the rest, see the next section, "Indenting Code"):

----
<!doctype html>
<body id="tlc-body">
  <script src="http://tlcjs.org/js/lodash.min.js"></script>
  <script src="http://tlcjs.org/js/tlc.js"></script>
  <script src="example1.js"></script>
----

== Indenting Code (and HTML) ==

(((block)))(((code structure)))(((whitespace)))(((programming
style)))You've probably noticed the spaces I put in front of some
statements. In JavaScript, these are not required—the computer will
accept the program just fine without them. In fact, even the ((line))
breaks in programs are optional. You could write a program as a single
long line if you felt like it. The role of the ((indentation)) inside
blocks is to make the structure of the code stand out. In complex
code, where new blocks are opened inside other blocks, it can become
hard to see where one block ends and another begins. With proper
indentation, the visual shape of a program corresponds to the shape of
the blocks inside it. I like to use two spaces for every open block,
but tastes differ—some people use four spaces, and some people use
((tab character))s.


Next open up the other file, `example1.js`. To start, we will use one of the simplest operations, `print`, which simply prints a value on the page. In this case, we'll just print out the number 1:

----
print(1);
----

The `;` at the end of the line is an indication that we've finished
the current operation. We'll get into this more later.

Now save that file too, and open up `example1.html` in a web browser. You can do this either by going to `File->Open` in the browser or dragging the file onto the application icon (if applicable). When you do that, you should see a page with `1` on it.

Congratulations! You've just written your first program!
